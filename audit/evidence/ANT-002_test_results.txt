=== OVERALL VERDICT ===

TASK-002 PASS

The IAMBecca activation pattern works correctly:
- All role files exist and are structured properly
- Shared modules are present and referenced
- BECCA → Oracle handoff produces correct artifacts
- Approval tokens are present and properly formatted

One minor issue found (IM-03 missing header) but this is cosmetic and does not affect functionality.
